of resolutions, high \\nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \\nthe card is available in both 16-bit isa bus and 32-bit vesa local \\nbus versions (models 8500 and 8500vl).\\n        with 1mb dram on board, the windowsvga 24 card offers \\nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \\nof 72hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \\nnon-interlaced. both models provide performance many times greater \\nthan standard svga boards, yet conform to all current video \\nstandards.\\n        windowsvga 24 features genoa\\'s flickerfree(tm) technology, \\nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \\ncomfortable.  the cards also come with safescan(tm), a utility \\ndeveloped by genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \\nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\\n        windowsvga model 8500vl takes full advantage of the speed \\noffered by the new vesa local bus technology.  most vl bus cards \\nwill only handle data transfers up to 33mhz, but the 8500vl will \\ntransfer data at the full speed of the cpu, up to 50mhz.  genoa is \\nalso offering this card in the \"turbobahn\" combination packaged \\nwith their turboexpress 486vl motherboard.\\n        built around the cirrus logic gd-5426 gui accelerator, \\nwindowsvga 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance \\nvalue.  genoa\\'s advanced proprietary drivers act to \"turbocharge\" \\nthe chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with \\npower and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced \\nchip cards.  the genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and \\nreliability for such programs as windows, autocad, autoshade, 3d \\nstudio, os/2, orcad and more.  driver updates and product bulletins \\nare available on genoa\\'s bbs at (408) 943-1231.\\n        genoa systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of \\ngraphics adapters, motherboards,

with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  the tool allows any\\n  virtual instrument (vi, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  national instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (dsp)\\n  boards for macintoshs and pc compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  new software tools for\\n  dsp are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. the\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  there are three levels of dsp programming\\n  associated with the nb-dsp2300 board and labview:\\n  use of the nb-dsp2300 analysis library: ffts, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from think c and macintosh programers workshop (mpw) c\\n  that execute on the nb-dsp2300 board. there is an analysis virtual\\n  interface library of ready-to-use vis optimized for the nb-dsp2300.\\n\\n  use of the national instruments developers toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing c compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the dsp hardware.  this approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  use of the national instruments interface kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the nb-dsp2300 board. (this is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nultimage concept vi\\n-------------------\\n  concept vi  by graftek-france is a family of image processing virtual\\n  instruments (vis) that give labview 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  a vi is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. typical applications for concept vi include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  ultimage concept vi addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  it includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  the program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  standard input and\\n  output formats include pict, tiff, satie, and aipd.  other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  measures are saved in ascii format.  the\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  a 3-d view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  the histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. the twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  there are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  these include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  the frequency data resulting from fft analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  the morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  the transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  the program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  gtfs, inc. 2455 bennett valley road #100c santa rosa, ca 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\niplab spectrum\\n--------------\\n  iplab spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  graftek-franceus ultimage concept vi.  using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. the problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. the tool\\n  supports: ffts, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nmacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nncsa image, ncsa paledit and

data from video images.  image analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  it is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  image analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  image analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  within minutes, without the need for programming, the image analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from tiff or pict files or from captured video tape images.\\n  image analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  the tool provides direct support for the data translation and\\n  scion frame grabbers. a menu command allows for image capture from a vcr\\n  video camera or other ntsc or pal devices.\\n\\n  there are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  automated sequences are set up in regions of interest (roi)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  inside a roi, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  image analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. the application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. it also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (clut) tool.\\n\\n  automatix, inc. 775 middlesex turnpike billerica, ma 01821

documentation (postscript mostly)\\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/text/publ.  installation requires building\\n  the system and thus a fortran and c compiler.\\n     this package can read and write fits data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of radio astronomy\\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the very large array (vla), a\\n  synthesis instrument.  it consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\\n  there is an x11-based image tool (xas) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\\n  graphics tool built into aips.  the xas tool is modelled after the hardware\\n  functionality of the international imaging systems model 70 display unit and\\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\\n    the code is mostly fortran 77 with some system c language modules, and is\\n  available for suns, ibm rs/6000, dec/ultrix, convex, cray (unicos), and\\n  alliant with support planned for hp-9000/7xx, solaris 2.1, and maybe sgi.\\n     there is currently a project - \"aips++\" - underway to rewrite the\\n  algorithmic functionality of aips in a modern setting, using c++ and an\\n  object oriented approach.  whereas aips is proprietary code (licensed for\\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by nrao and the nsf, aips++ will be\\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\\n  contributions from the us, canada, england, the netherlands,

is a powerful\\n  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in\\n  interactive times.\\n\\n  feature description\\n\\n  disimp incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and\\n  spatial data options. all functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  disimp executive. this menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  principal component analysis. disimp also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  host configuration requirements\\n\\n  running on unix workstations, disimp is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  disimp is available in both runtime and programmer\\'s environments. using\\n  the programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  graphics are governed by an icon-based display panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. manipulations of look up tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  a range of geographic projections enables disimp to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  the system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. disimp comes fully configured with no optional extras. the\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  for further

processing system)\\n\\n  michael landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\\n  exploration, etc.).  it is called hips, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  it has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  feature description\\n\\n  hips  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. it  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  as a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. additionally, hips allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   new users\\n  become effective using hips on their first day.\\n\\n  hips features images that are  self-documenting.   each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   hips includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of unix\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  it comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  host configuration requirements\\n\\n  originally  developed at  new  york  university,  hips  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  it runs under the unix operating\\n  system.  it is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and\\n  microvax, sun, apollo,  masscomp,  ncr tower, iris, ibm at, etc.\\n  for image display and input, drivers are supplied for the grinnell and\\n  adage (ikonas) image processors, and the sun-2, sun-3, sun- 4, and\\n  sun-386i consoles.  we also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (sun gfx, sun\\n  console, matrox vip-1024, iti ip-512, lexidata,  macintosh ii, x\\n  windowing system, and iris).  the hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  crs-4000. it  is  a  simple matter to interface hips\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max-\\n  video. hips can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of hips is machine independent.\\n\\n  availability\\n\\n  hips has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. it\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. hips\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  michael landy sharpimage

thalmanns animation system from\\n  montreal. these are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  mira stands for microcomputer image reduction and analysis.  mira gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 dos computers using svga cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. mira contains a very handsome/functional\\n  gui which is mouse and keystroke operated. mira reads/writes tiff and fits\\n  formats, native formats of a number of ccd cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. the result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. mira does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the intel hardware.  the entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  there are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. a wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nsupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: laplacian, sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  ellipse, rectangle,\\n   line, gradient, gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to\\n   any specified angle.\\no  ccd data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column

computer \\nperipheral connectivity.  access.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost i2c technology to link multiple devices to \\na single pc port.  peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (mice, trackballs, joysticks), printers, vr \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host pc.  applications \\nsuch as cad/cam, data acquisition, simulation, virtual reality, \\nmultiple-player/single pc games, education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of access.bus, the technology that puts \\nplug and play on every pc.\\n\\nthe access.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  as an open standard, access.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\naccess.bus technological description:\\n=====================================\\n\\naccess.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\naccess.bus has a bus topology architecture.  that is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  access.bus \\ndata rate is 100 kbits/sec.\\n\\naccess.bus physical layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\naccess.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on i2c hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nstandard low-cost i2c microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\naccess.bus software protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthe access.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: i2c protocol, base protocol, and application protocol.\\n\\ni2c protocol: this simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  i2c \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nbase protocol: establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  the host becomes the \\naccess.bus manager.  the base protocol defines the format of an \\naccess.bus message envelope, which is an i2c bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nunique features of the base protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\napplication protocol: this is the highest level of the access.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  each type requires a different application \\nprotocol.  three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\naccess.bus support on the pc\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nall three levels of the access.bus protocol are supported on the \\npc.  an add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical access.bus devices.  \\nan access.bus manager - tsr under dos and a dll under windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe access.bus device drivers.  drivers are available for \\nmultiple access.bus keyboards, locators and printers for dos and \\nwindows 3.1.  also available are c language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nto contact abig (the access.bus industry group):\", \"\\ni

designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the\\nsame as x, but while x is intended for high-bandwidth network connections,\\nnaplps was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.\\n\\ni'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. if you\\nwanted to provide a full network connection to linux over a modem would you\\nuse slip/ppp or would you invent some new way? most people would say that\\nslip/ppp exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just\\nimplement them. i see it the same way with naplps. it is an existing,

movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe earth shuttle is approaching the space station. specifically, i digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. to increase the differences between frames, i digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\ni captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the spigot\\ncard in my centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a pal source). i then\\nimported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. i created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. i used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\ni then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"raw speed test\" program i used\\nfor the results i\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nresult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nthat\\'s right, i was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. just for fun, i copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a quantum lp105s), and ran it from there. this time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. obviously the 230mb internal hard disk\\n(also a quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\ni modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. this time the playback speed was over 60 fps. clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. i\\'d try my tests with quicktime 1.0, but i don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my centris and system 7.1...\\n\\nunscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nthe other thing i tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within movieplayer (ie with quicktime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\na preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. i can\\'t believe that quicktime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\na preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: i couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. at 8.0 (=> 40 fps) i *think* i could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\ni guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...', 'does any one know of a decent quality library of routines for\\nperforming 3d graphics modelling on the pc?\\n\\nideally the

the\\ne&s freedom.\\n\\n\\nhere is the text of a denali vs. e&s freedom done by d.h. brown associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\ndenali bears a strong resemblance to evans and sutherlands freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  as a result, denali and freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nthere remain, however, several important differences between the kpc and\\ne&s products.  evans and sutherland designed freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  in its favor, freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than denali.  all freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  the freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  finally, e&s provided freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  note\\nthat kpc is working an auxiliary board for ntsc and pal output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  e&s programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nthe kpc design team, in contrast, made denali more of an end-user's system.\\nentry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nfreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  denali does not need as many 29050 modules as freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3d, imaging, and volume rendering, kpc recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nboth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack sgi's more expensive\\nvgxt and realityengine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  kpc supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  on balance, however, denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than e&s for most applications.\\naside from being much more affordable, kpc solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  by implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, e&s foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.  kubota avoids this problem by linking\\ntexturing to its frame buffer modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\\nsolution.\\n\\nhope this

problem with our workstations.  i was also\\nshocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  this seems huge, but is only\\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  in those terms it doesn\\'t seem so bad.  what\\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\\nmainly to roundoff, i believe.  so the polygon is not planar in z, but is\\nmore like a ruffles potato chip.  ditto with lines.  when you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.  you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  you will likely see\\na smeared effect where they overlap.\\n  example:\\n  try polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\\n      polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\\n\\nyour implementation is correct.  in fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as nurbs surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.  without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\\nyou say.  when the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\\napplication must do it.  this is what you have discovered and are doing.\\nbravo!\\n\\n(note to ibm\\'ers:  the information given here has been previously disclosed\\nthrough proper channels so i\\'m not giving away any new unpublished info.)\\n',

terry winograd); the edited\\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (a plan for\\nknowledge archives project in japan and csli in stanford, pp. 81-100);\\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). this structure is mentioned to\\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\\ninto the discourse.\\n   a great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. this page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced ai, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. i asked professor terry winograd to write this\\npage for number 2. i certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   on the second page of each number an editor's profile is published.\\nthe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side. this kind of story should\\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \\nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\\n   the edited part (edited papers) is still critical. i would like to have\\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. january, april, july, and october). in situation\\nright now, i ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. some critical views to the\\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\\na special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\\n   reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\\nyou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\\non the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\\nin informatica. we in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\\n   e-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\\nyou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and

receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning\\nour common interest and job.\\n\\nat the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in\\nevery mentioned respect. the

touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\\n\\n   the following is the relevant sections from the man page. \\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\npre-release of may, 1993                                       bit(1l)\\n\\nname\\n   bit - bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations\\n\\ndescription\\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\\n  silicon graphics gl. as a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  as an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. you can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (the\\n  slideshow).  with the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  as an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. it keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  in addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. postscript).\\n\\n  bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nfeatures\\n\\n  bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  current features include\\n\\n  o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a postscript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in tex(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  the transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. further, the transformation can be applied to rgb channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o places simple geometric figures (sgfs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    postscript file). all sgfs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o performs edge detection. in combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (slideshow)\\n\\n  o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o converts image formats.\\n\\n  o smoothes an image (special convolution).\\n\\n  o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o modify an individual pixel\\'s rgb values.\\n\\n  o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n supported formats\\n      o  iris rgb, native to sgi iris\\n      o  jpeg(jfif) format\\n      o  compuserv gif\\n      o  pnm(portable any map), including ppm, pgm and pbm.\\n      o  xbm (x window bitmap)\\n      o  tiff\\n      o  postscript(write only)\\n\\nhardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nwhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.z\\n   where xxx is the version number. current version is 0.73\\n\\n   read src/01readme for installation instructions after unpacking\\n\\nacknowledgement:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groups\\'s library version 4.\\n   forms library, developed by mark overmars, is used for gui.\\n   both jpeg and forms library are included in this release.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n  bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate\\n  images; the built-in editing features will satisfy most of\\n  your editing needs. in addition, the external filter and dynamical\\n  kernel will utilize any program you already have. so try it\\n  (and you will like it).', 'i\\'m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low\\napparent precision in z-buffering, that i\\'ve encountered in 2 different\\npex implementations.  i can\\'t find any discussion of this problem in any\\nresources i can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex faq, gaskins\\'s\\n_pexlib_programming_manual_, vendors\\' documentation).\\n\\ni\\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  the problem is hard to describe without pictures,\\nhence this article is longish.  if you can run pexlib 5.x programs and\\nare interested, i encourage you to build and run the test program in\\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\\nto dealing with it.  (it depends on the utility code from the above\\ngaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous ftp are given.)\\n\\nthe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\\nartifacts resulting from the use of z-buffering with polylines that are\\ncoplanar with filled areas.  the interpolated z values along a line will\\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated z values\\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\\nvertices of the area.  because of this, it\\'s a tossup whether the\\nz-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\\nvisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\\nline is supposed to be solid.\\n\\nusing the pexlib api, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\\ndifferent pex view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  the pex structures or immediate-\\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  the\\nresult is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines, so as to\\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\\n\\nthis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\\nin the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\\nsmaller vrc z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\\ntable entry used for areas.  this means that when a point is transformed\\nto npc, its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\\n\\ni would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the z-buffer,\\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit z-buffers).\\ntherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc\\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\\nthe stitching.\\n\\nbut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\\nto 0.006 of the range.  (empirically, it\\'s worst when the npc z\\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  it\\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\\nz-buffer have any dependable meaning!  this amount is so great that one\\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines \"show through\"\\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\\n\\ni\\'ve observed the problem on both hewlett-packard and digital\\nworkstation pex servers, to approximately the same degree.  the test\\nprogram demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 5.x implementation;\\nthis version is known to compile and run on an hp-ux system with pex\\n5.1.\\n\\nopen questions:\\n    (1) why does this happen?\\n        --  am i configuring the pex view table wrongly?\\n        --  is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines\\n            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which\\n            could be corrected for?\\n        --  are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their\\n            interpolators?\\n        --  something else?\\n    (2) what to do about it?\\n        --  can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision\\n            in z-buffered hlhsr?\\n        --  is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching\\n            artifacts?\\n        --  am i just out of luck?\\n\\nany help would be immensely appreciated!\\n', \"\\nhow about the gnu people, handing out very good, free software?

(definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\\n     fit them congregate.)  6. an expert or enthusiast of any kind.  one\\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. one who enjoys the\\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] a malicious meddler who tries to\\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  hence \\'password\\n     hacker\\', \\'network hacker\\'.  see {cracker}.\\n\\n     the term \\'hacker\\' also tends to connote membership in the global\\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\\n     {internet address}).  it also implies that the person described\\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\\n\\n     it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\\n     oneself that way.  hackers consider themselves something of an\\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\\n     members are gladly welcome.  there is thus a certain ego\\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\\n     you claim to be one and are not, you\\'ll quickly be labeled\\n     {bogus}).  see also {wannabee}.\\n\\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. the belief that information-sharing\\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\\n     wherever possible.  2. the belief that system-cracking for fun\\n     and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits\\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\\n\\n     both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. most hackers subscribe\\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\\n     giving away free software.  a few go further and assert that\\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {gnu}\\n     project.\\n\\n     sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\\n     but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\\n     see themselves as `benign\\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  on\\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\\n\\n     the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\\n     resources with other hackers.  huge cooperative networks such as\\n     {usenet}, {fidonet} and internet (see {internet address})\\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\\n     hackerdom\\'s most valuable intangible asset.\\n\\n:  finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\\n: to me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\\n: says \"nahh, i just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\\n\\nnote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\\nnot to do so.  there are many who do not know the meaning of \\'hacker\\'.  so,\\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\\nworkplace.  (this means that \\'hacker\\' is defined in terms of some well-known\\nand respected person.)  sometimes, there may only be one such person.\\n\\n: >no matter what mr. dumpty says, language doesn\\'t work that way.\\n:  actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\\n\\nlanguage works anyway that we want it to work.  the purpose of language is\\nto communicate.  to oversimplify: as long as communication is taking place,\\nthen language is working.\\n', ': ==============================================================================\\n: could someone please tell

conference was organized by the rensse-\\n          laer design research center in co-operation with  ieee  and  sig-\\n          graph.   attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\\n          tinents.   a  good  cross-section  of  the  phigs  community  was\\n          represented  at this conference with participants including phigs\\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party phigs implementors, stan-\\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\\n          academia.  the opening speaker, dr. richard puk, challenged phigs\\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your phigs\" by participating in phigs\\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to phigs\\n          implementors.    the   closing  speaker,  dr.  andries  van  dam,\\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\\n          phigs\".\\n\\n          technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\\n          topics:  phigs  and  x, application toolkits, application issues,\\n          texture mapping, nurbs,  phigs  extensions,  and  object-oriented\\n          libraries and frameworks.  panel sessions on phigs and pex, phigs\\n          non-retained data, real-world cad applications using  phigs,  and\\n          portability  issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   the\\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\\n          ing from mathematics for

system around which a world/campus-wide\\n     information system (cwis) can readily be constructed.   while\\n     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  gopher\\n     facilitates access to other gopher and information servers\\n     throughout the world. \\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nq1:  where can i get gopher software?\\n\\na1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  look in the directory\\n     /pub/gopher\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nq2:  what do i need to access gopher?\\n\\na2:  you will need a gopher \"client\" program that runs on your local pc\\n     or workstation\\n\\n     there are clients for the following systems.  the directory\\n     following the

gopher software?\\n\\na4:  gopher was originally developed in april 1991 by the university\\n     of minnesota microcomputer, workstation, networks center to help\\n     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  \\n\\n     it has since grown into a full-fledged world wide information\\n     system used by a large number of sites in the world.\\n\\n     many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to\\n     count. \\n\\n     the people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached\\n     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:\\n   \\n      internet gopher developers\\n      100 union st. se #190\\n      minneapolis, mn 55455  usa\\n\\n     or via fax at:\\n \\n      +1 (612) 625-6817\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\nq5: what is the relationship between gopher and (wais, www, ftp)?\\n\\na5: gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.\\n     as shipped the unix gopher server has the capability to: \\n     \\n       - search local wais indices.\\n       - query remote wais servers and funnel the results to gopher\\n         clients.\\n       - query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher\\n         clients.\\n       - be queried by www (world wide web) clients (either using\\n         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nq6: are papers or articles describing gopher available?\\n\\na6: gopher has

quicktime,\\n   the effects of scaling and so on, i thought i\\'d do some more tests.\\n\\n   first of all, i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\\n   realistic. the movie i had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\n   version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor).\\n   i decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n   (for better or for worse).\\n\\n   i pulled out a copy of \"2001: a space odyssey\" that i had recorded off tv\\n   a while back. about fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\n   the earth shuttle is approaching the space station. specifically, i digitized\\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\n   station. i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\n   frames. to increase the differences between frames, i digitized it at only\\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\n   i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the spigot\\n   card in my centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a pal source). i then\\n   imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor,\\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. i created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. i used the default\\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\n   frames.\\n\\n   i then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"raw speed test\" program i used\\n   for the results i\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\n   result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\n   that\\'s right, i was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\n   test movie. just for fun, i copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\n   disk (a quantum lp105s), and ran it from there. this time the playback rate\\n   was only about 35 frames per second. obviously the 230mb internal hard disk\\n   (also a quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\n   i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\n   size. this time the playback speed was over 60 fps. clearly, the poster who\\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 1.0 in\\n   action, not 1.5. i\\'d try my tests with quicktime 1.0, but i don\\'t think it\\'s\\n   entirely compatible with my centris and system 7.1...\\n\\n   unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\n   the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\n   from within movieplayer (ie with quicktime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\n   a preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\n   very jerky. compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\n   ease. i can\\'t believe that quicktime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\n   much overhead: i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system\\'s task\\n   switching.\\n\\n   a preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: i couldn\\'t see\\n   any evidence of stutter. at 8.0 (=> 40 fps) i *think* i could see slight\\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\n   i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. of course, this will also\\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\n   even more...\\n\\n   lawrence d\\'oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\n   computer services dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\n   university of waikato            electric

significantly affect quicktime\\'s playback speed that you may want to take\\ninto account:\\n\\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\\n\\n(2) type of scaling (qt is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\\n\\n(3) playback window position (movieplayer limits your window placement choices\\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, i\\'m not sure about premiere).\\n\\nany combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  image size\\nis, of course, another biggie.  giving the movie player lots of ram can also\\nmake a real difference.\\n\\nforgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\\n\\n-peter lee\\n\\n ', ': i have a question about svga cards.  i have a tseng 4000 svga with 1mb\\n: memory and 3x 6-bit dacs as far as i know.  to display a

this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  why use jpeg?\\n\\nthere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nmaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  being able to compress a\\n2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (if you are comparing gif and jpeg, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  more details below.)\\n\\nif your viewing software doesn\\'t support jpeg directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  even\\nwith a jpeg-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (gif, for instance).  thus, using\\njpeg is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nit\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  i\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nthe other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet\\nposting format is that jpeg can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  if you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  within a couple of years, though, 8-bit gif will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white macpaint format does today.  furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  hence jpeg is considerably\\nmore appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  when should i use jpeg, and when should i stick with gif?\\n\\njpeg is *not* going to displace gif entirely; for some types of images,\\ngif is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  one of the first\\nthings to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nas a rule of thumb, jpeg is superior to gif for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  jpeg is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a lot superior if you do.  (see section 7 for details.)\\n\\ngif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  in particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby gif.  jpeg can\\'t squeeze these files as much as gif does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  this sort of image is best kept in gif form.\\n(in particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in gif files, but they\\nshould be avoided in jpeg files.)\\n\\njpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in gif files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  the blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nif you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t jpeg it.\\n\\ncomputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  the more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that jpeg will do well on it.\\nthe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nplain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to jpeg.\\nyou need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while jpeg is not.\\n\\nif you have an existing library of gif images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to jpeg.  you will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(section 7, which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  if you start from\\na gif, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; jpeg\\ncan only make things worse.)  however, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  this is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nif you do convert a gif library to jpeg, see section 14 for hints.  be\\nprepared to leave some images in gif format, since some gifs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  how well does jpeg compress images?\\n\\npretty darn well.  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  the first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free jpeg\\nsoftware described in section 6b.\\n\\nfile\\t   size in bytes\\t\\tcomments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  original file in ppm format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.z\\t 963829  ppm file passed through unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  converted to gif with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: gif saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (see sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t this is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t this has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been jpeged without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t jpeg\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t still, i\\'ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  note that this file is tiny:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nin this case jpeg can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a gif of comparable quality (the -q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\ngif, better if you have a full-color display).  this seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  what are good \"quality\" settings for jpeg?\\n\\nmost jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  there seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"quality 95\" does not mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  the quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nthe name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nthe default quality setting (-q 75) is very often the best choice.  this\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  try -q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -q 95; saying -q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nif the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -q 50 without objectionable degradation.  on the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nthe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg.\\nthe default -q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting gifs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nif you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg\\nsoftware described in section 6b, and to many programs based on it.  other\\njpeg implementations, such as image alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  where can i get jpeg software?\\n\\nmost of the programs described in this section are available by ftp.\\nif you don\\'t know how to use ftp, see the faq article \"how to find sources\".\\n(if you don\\'t have direct access to ftp, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  that article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  the \"anonymous ftp\\nlist faq\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nnote: this list changes constantly.  if you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6a]  if you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nthe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  if you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable jpeg software described at the end of the list.  note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\ninternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nx windows:\\n\\nxv (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for jpeg, gif, and many other\\nimage formats.  it can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  it\\'s available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.z.  version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to jpeg.  but 2.21 works\\nfine for converting gif and other 8-bit images to jpeg.  caution: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a jpeg file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nanother good choice for x windows is john cristy\\'s free imagemagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z.\\nthis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  the\\nimagemagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than xv or the\\nbasic free jpeg software.\\n\\nboth of the above are large, complex packages.  if you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to jpeg files, because it has the ijg v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  the next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z.  both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nms-dos:\\n\\nthis covers plain dos; for windows or os/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\none good choice is eric praetzel\\'s free dvpeg, which views jpeg and gif files.\\nthe current version, 2.5, is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  this is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  the user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nanother freeware jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei\\'s hiview.  the\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  hiview requires a 386 or better cpu\\nand a vcpi-compatible memory manager (qemm386 and 386max work; windows and\\nos/2 do not).  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  for larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nyou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\na shareware alternative is colorview for dos ($30).  this is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally i find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  it is faster than dvpeg but a\\nlittle slower than hiview, at least on my hardware.  (for images larger than\\nscreen size, dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than hiview.)  the current version is 2.1, available from\\nsimtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nrequires a vesa graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (many recent pcs have a built-in\\nvesa driver, so don\\'t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\na second shareware alternative is fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but i don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nthe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nthe author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nthe well-known gif viewer compushow (cshow) supports jpeg in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  however, cshow\\'s jpeg implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood jpeg capability in cshow.  shareware, $25.  available from simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see note below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\ndue to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  if you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert jpeg to gif, then view with your favorite gif viewer.  (if you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use gif as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a targa-capable viewer instead.  vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nthe independent jpeg group\\'s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  these files are dos\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6b; they will\\nconvert jpeg to and from gif, targa, and ppm formats.\\n\\nhandmade software offers free jpeg<=>gif conversion tools, gif2jpg/jpg2gif.\\nthese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a jpeg.  the major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi\\'s proprietary\\njpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format.  since hsi-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on bbses, this is a useful capability.  version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  get it from\\nsimtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nnote: do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-pc platforms.\\n\\nhandmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, image alchemy.  this will translate jpeg files (both jfif and hsi\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  it can also display images.\\na demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nnote about simtel20: the internet\\'s key archive site for pc-related programs\\nis simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  simtel20\\nruns a non-unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  if you are not physically on milnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20.  there are several\\ninternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the simtel20 archives;\\nmost ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  a popular usa\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  if you have no ftp capability, you can\\nretrieve files from simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  if you are outside the usa,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nmicrosoft windows:\\n\\nthere are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images.\\n(windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to windows\\' system overhead.  note that you can run the dos conversion\\nprograms described above inside a windows dos window.)\\n\\nthe newest entry is winecj, which is free and extremely fast.  version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nrequires windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  this is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nbut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\njview is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in windows bmp format; but it can\\'t create new jpeg\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view gifs.  jview also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  the current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nwinjpeg (shareware, $20) displays jpeg,gif,targa,tiff, and bmp image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nit has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see note above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (this is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\ncolorview is another shareware entry ($30).  this was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over winjpeg.  if you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.

(see section 10 for\\ndetails.)  if you post images on usenet, make sure they are in jfif format.\\nmost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nthe first choice is probably jpegview, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in jfif format, pict/jpeg format, or gif format.  it also can\\nconvert between the two jpeg formats.  the current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  requires system 7 and\\nquicktime.  on 8-bit displays, jpegview usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers.  jpegview can\\nview large images in much less memory than other mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4mb mac.  given a large image, jpegview automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (you can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  overall, jpegview\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\ngifconverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports jfif and\\npict/jpeg, as well as gif and several other image formats.  the latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  requires system 6.0.5 or later.\\ngifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  also, the newest version of gifconverter can\\nload and save jfif images *without* quicktime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run quicktime.  (but it\\'s faster with quicktime.)\\nnote: if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg, try\\nconverting the file to gif with jpeg convert, then viewing the gif version.\\n\\njpeg convert, a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nthis will run on any mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nyou can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer.\\n\\nprevious versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6, a jpeg<=>gif\\nconverter based on an old version of the ijg code.  if you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert.\\n\\napple\\'s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif, quicktime jpeg, and\\ngif format, and can convert between these formats.  you can get pictpixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nrequires quicktime.  pictpixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime.\\nsome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  worse, pictpixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (there is an old version of pictpixie, called\\npictcompressor, floating around the net.  if you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  also, the quicktime starter kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor.  note that\\npicture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nstorm technology\\'s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer/converter.\\nthis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without system 7 or quicktime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (it does need 32-bit quickdraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  you must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'jpeg\\' to allow picture decompress to open it.\\n\\nif your machine is too old to run 32-bit quickdraw (a mac plus for instance),\\ngifconverter is your only choice for single-program jpeg viewing.  if you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for gifconverter, use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer.\\n\\nmore and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg, although not\\nall can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format.  adobe photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write jfif-format jpeg files (use the jpeg\\nplug-in from the acquire menu).  you must set the file type of a downloaded\\njpeg file to \\'jpeg\\' to allow photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\namiga:\\n\\n(most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  there are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  in the usa, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nhamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  it\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides jpeg.  the current version is 2.0.8.  a demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  the demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nrend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display jpeg, ilbm,\\nand gif images.  the program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like lightwave.  the\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.

(this is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  we\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nclearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  it turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg (except at\\nthe very lowest jpeg quality settings).\\n\\nsince jpeg is a full-color format, converting a color jpeg image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  this is true for\\n*all* color jpegs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nthis happens because jpeg\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color jpeg on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a jpeg image.  even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different jpeg decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  i occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color jpeg\".  this tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this faq and (b) probably converted the jpeg from a gif.\\njpegs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for jpeg.)\\n\\non the other hand, a gif image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (a gif *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nfor purposes of usenet picture distribution, gif has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nthis is also the *disadvantage* of gif: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nfurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nfor this reason, jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\njpeg\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of jpeg\\nimages you already have.  with a gif, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nit\\'s also worth mentioning that many gif-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the gif, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  thus, jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average\\ngif program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nfinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" pc displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and macintoshes, etc.  for these people, gif is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nthus, jpeg is an all-around better choice than gif for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  how does jpeg work?\\n\\nthe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  this article\\'s long enough already, so i\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  for technical information, see the comp.compression faq.\\nthis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  if you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  what about lossless jpeg?\\n\\nthere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  the jpeg committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  however, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy jpeg\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  at present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless jpeg exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nsaying \"-q 100\" to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image.\\nwhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  there is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (with the v4 free jpeg code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  keep in mind that many commercial\\njpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\neven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular jpeg\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nat this minimum-loss setting, regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  true lossless jpeg\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nif you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\njbig bilevel image compression standard.  this performs better than jpeg\\nlossless on such images.  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, jpeg is public domain (at least with a\\nhuffman back end), while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nstrictly speaking, jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  the jpeg committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nsince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  in the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nthe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at c-cube microsystems.  they have defined\\ntwo jpeg-based file formats:\\n  * jfif (jpeg file interchange format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * tiff/jpeg, aka tiff 6.0, an extension of the aldus tiff format.  tiff is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  tiff is\\n    a lot more complex than jfif, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of tiff.  it\\'s not likely that adding jpeg to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nboth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof jpeg-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\ni believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in\\npicture postings.  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now; the\\ntiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  even when tiff/jpeg is well\\ndefined, the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; tiff/jpeg files may never be as transportable.\\n\\na particular case that people may be interested in is apple\\'s quicktime\\nsoftware for the macintosh.  quicktime uses a jfif-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the mac-specific pict structure.  conversion between jfif and\\nquicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward, and several mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see mac portion of section 6a).  if you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nanother particular case is handmade software\\'s programs (gif2jpg/jpg2gif and\\nimage alchemy).  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif\\nformat.  by default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nhsi.  this format is not readable by any non-hsi programs and should not be\\nused for usenet postings.  use the -j switch to get jfif output.  (this\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit jfif\\nformat by default.  you still should be careful not to post hsi-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-pc platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  how do i recognize which file format i have, and what do i do about it?\\n\\nif you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format.  you can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  a jfif-standard file will start with the characters (hex) ff d8 ff e0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'jfif\\'.\\n\\n2.  if you see ff d8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw jpeg\" file.  this is probably decodable as-is by jfif software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  hsi files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  you\\'re out of luck unless you have hsi\\n    software.  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-hsi programs.\\n\\n4.  a macintosh pict file, if jpeg-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a jfif header (scan for \\'jfif\\').  strip off\\n    everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not jpeg at all.  if you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream.\\n    if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream (look for ff d8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nin uuencoded usenet postings, the characteristic jfif pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tm_]c_x ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded hsi files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tm:\\'-i ...\\n\\nif you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-jfif files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  what about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nthe jpeg spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nthe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  on typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding.  (all the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding.)\\n\\nunfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\njpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm, at&t, and mitsubishi.\\nthus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (the \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nat least in the short run, i recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  in particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on usenet.\\n\\nthere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nit would be nice if, having compressed an image with jpeg, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nunfortunately this is not the case.  in general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nthe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical jpeg file.  even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree jpeg software.  it\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  if you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\none of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but i am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nin any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(if you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nif you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nthe bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  use a lossless format\\n(ppm, rle, tiff, etc) while working on the image, then jpeg it when you are\\nready to file it away.  aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg?\\n\\nas stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing gif image to jpeg.  if you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the gif was made from, it\\'s far better to make a jpeg from\\nthat.  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nthe first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding gif;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  some gifs may be better left as gifs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the gif.  (so check the sizes too.)\\n\\nexperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality gifs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to jpeg.  they chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to jpeg with least degradation.\\ndon\\'t waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes.  also, don\\'t\\nexpect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  to maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\njpeg files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nmany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a gif image.  while useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in gif files.  it is not free in jpeg files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before jpeging.  (if you are on an x windows\\nsystem, xv\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor gif inputs, q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (if you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nq setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\ncolor gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store.\\nif you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  the\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to jpeg, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and jpeg can\\'t compress noise very well.  the resulting jpeg\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from jpeging the original full color image (if you had it).\\nto get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the gif image before compression.\\nsmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give jpeg trouble.  appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nwith the v4 free jpeg software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting gifs.\\nvalues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality gifs.  heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (if you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  if you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the pbmplus package.  however, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na lot faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nthe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting gifs.  but if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nfor more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in\\nparticular, contact the independent jpeg group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n', '\\ti heard that there is a vesa driver for the xga-2 card available on \\ncompuserve. i just got this card, and i am wondering if this driver is \\navailable on a ftp site anywhere. my news service has beeen erratic lately so\\nplease e-mail me at:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twalsh@stolaf.edu\\n\\tthanks in advance. \\n', \"hi.  i'm  looking for information on how to directly manipulate\\n video memory.  i have an application that i would like to use this for,\\n because it is much faster than going through the bios.  i know that\\n video memory ispart of the system area above the first 640k, so i guess\\n i am looking to find out exactly what section of memory it is, and how it\\n is layed out.     thanks.\", \"\\n\\n \\ncertainly. reference follows. \\n\\nbear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\\nred/green colour blind. one, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the l cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. this gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nthe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional m cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the l-m cone difference signals in the retina.\\nit also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nunlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\non a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. for protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. for deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nnote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. the values quoted are typical.\\n\\nso if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nthis problem has now been solved. tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. for protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*so* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) this is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nthe best reference for this is meyer, g.w. & greenberg, d.p. (1988) 'colour\\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', ieee computer graphics and\\napplications 8(5) 28-40.\\n\\nyou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\\nfamiliar with the cie xyz colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\\n\\n\\nyes this is certainly possible. you will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point. this information can be measured, or\\nobtained from the manufacturer. i posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\\ncouple of weeks ago.\\n\\nthe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (some lookup tables might be a\\nhelp here.)\\n\\na) convert rgb to cie xyz. this is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\\nhave the monitor data.\\nb) retaining the y component for later, convert xyz to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\\nusing u' = 4x/(x+15y+3z), v' = 9y/(x+15y+3z)\\nc) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\\nd) find the intersection as in step 3\\ne) convert back from u'v' to xyz, using the y value from step a\\nf) ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\\nalong a line in xyz space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\\nwhite) until it is displayable.\\n\\n\\ndone; also posted for the rest of us.\\n\\n--\\nchris

jpeg?\\n\\njpeg (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism.\\njpeg stands for joint photographic experts group, the original name of the\\ncommittee that wrote the standard.  jpeg is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nit does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\njpeg does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named jbig and mpeg\\nrespectively.\\n\\njpeg is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  the algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  thus, jpeg is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  if you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\na useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  this means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  you can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  why use jpeg?\\n\\nthere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nmaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  being able to compress a\\n2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (if you are comparing gif and jpeg, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  more details below.)\\n\\nif your viewing software doesn\\'t support jpeg directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  even\\nwith a jpeg-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (gif, for instance).  thus, using\\njpeg is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nit\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  i\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nthe other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet\\nposting format is that jpeg can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  if you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  within a couple of years, though, 8-bit gif will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white macpaint format does today.  furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  hence jpeg is considerably\\nmore appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  when should i use jpeg, and when should i stick with gif?\\n\\njpeg is *not* going to displace gif entirely; for some types of images,\\ngif is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  one of the first\\nthings to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nas a rule of thumb, jpeg is superior to gif for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  jpeg is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a lot superior if you do.  (see section 7 for details.)\\n\\ngif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  in particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby gif.  jpeg can\\'t squeeze these files as much as gif does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  this sort of image is best kept in gif form.\\n(in particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in gif files, but they\\nshould be avoided in jpeg files.)\\n\\njpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in gif files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  the blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nif you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t jpeg it.\\n\\ncomputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  the more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that jpeg will do well on it.\\nthe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nplain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to jpeg.\\nyou need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while jpeg is not.\\n\\nif you have an existing library of gif images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to jpeg.  you will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(section 7, which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  if you start from\\na gif, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; jpeg\\ncan only make things worse.)  however, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  this is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nif you do convert a gif library to jpeg, see section 14 for hints.  be\\nprepared to leave some images in gif format, since some gifs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  how well does jpeg compress images?\\n\\npretty darn well.  here are some sample file sizes for an image i have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  the first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free jpeg\\nsoftware described in section 6b.\\n\\nfile\\t   size in bytes\\t\\tcomments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  original file in ppm format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.z\\t 963829  ppm file passed through unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  converted to gif with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: gif saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (see sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t this is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t this has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been jpeged without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t jpeg\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t still, i\\'ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  note that this file is tiny:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nin this case jpeg can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a gif of comparable quality (the -q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\ngif, better if you have a full-color display).  this seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  what are good \"quality\" settings for jpeg?\\n\\nmost jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  there seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"quality 95\" does not mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  the quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nthe name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  this setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nthe default quality setting (-q 75) is very often the best choice.  this\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  try -q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -q 95; saying -q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nif the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -q 50 without objectionable degradation.  on the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nthe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg.\\nthe default -q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting gifs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nif you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg\\nsoftware described in section 6b, and to many programs based on it.  other\\njpeg implementations, such as image alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  where can i get jpeg software?\\n\\nmost of the programs described in this section are available by ftp.\\nif you don\\'t know how to use ftp, see the faq article \"how to find sources\".\\n(if you don\\'t have direct access to ftp, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  that article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  the \"anonymous ftp\\nlist faq\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nnote: this list changes constantly.  if you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6a]  if you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nthe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  if you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable jpeg software described at the end of the list.  note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\ninternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nx windows:\\n\\nxv (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for jpeg, gif, and many other\\nimage formats.  it can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  it\\'s available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.z.  version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  if you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to jpeg.  but 2.21 works\\nfine for converting gif and other 8-bit images to jpeg.  caution: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a jpeg file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nanother good choice for x windows is john cristy\\'s free imagemagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z.\\nthis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  the\\nimagemagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than xv or the\\nbasic free jpeg software.\\n\\nboth of the above are large, complex packages.  if you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to jpeg files, because it has the ijg v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  the next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z.  both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nms-dos:\\n\\nthis covers plain dos; for windows or os/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\none good choice is eric praetzel\\'s free dvpeg, which views jpeg and gif files.\\nthe current version, 2.5, is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  this is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  the user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nanother freeware jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei\\'s hiview.  the\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  hiview requires a 386 or better cpu\\nand a vcpi-compatible memory manager (qemm386 and 386max work; windows and\\nos/2 do not).  hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  for larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nyou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\na shareware alternative is colorview for dos ($30).  this is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally i find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  it is faster than dvpeg but a\\nlittle slower than hiview, at least on my hardware.  (for images larger than\\nscreen size, dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than hiview.)  the current version is 2.1, available from\\nsimtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nrequires a vesa graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (many recent pcs have a built-in\\nvesa driver, so don\\'t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\na second shareware alternative is fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but i don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nthe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nthe author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nthe well-known gif viewer compushow (cshow) supports jpeg in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  however, cshow\\'s jpeg implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood jpeg capability in cshow.  shareware, $25.  available from simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see note below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\ndue to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  if you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert jpeg to gif, then view with your favorite gif viewer.  (if you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use gif as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a targa-capable viewer instead.  vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nthe independent jpeg group\\'s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  these files are dos\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6b; they will\\nconvert jpeg to and from gif, targa, and ppm formats.\\n\\nhandmade software offers free jpeg<=>gif conversion tools, gif2jpg/jpg2gif.\\nthese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a jpeg.  the major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi\\'s proprietary\\njpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format.  since hsi-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on bbses, this is a useful capability.  version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  get it from\\nsimtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nnote: do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-pc platforms.\\n\\nhandmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, image alchemy.  this will translate jpeg files (both jfif and hsi\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  it can also display images.\\na demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nnote about simtel20: the internet\\'s key archive site for pc-related programs\\nis simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  simtel20\\nruns a non-unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  if you are not physically on milnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20.  there are several\\ninternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the simtel20 archives;\\nmost ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  a popular usa\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  if you have no ftp capability, you can\\nretrieve files from simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  if you are outside the usa,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nmicrosoft windows:\\n\\nthere are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images.\\n(windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to windows\\' system overhead.  note that you can run the dos conversion\\nprograms described above inside a windows dos window.)\\n\\nthe newest entry is winecj, which is free and extremely fast.  version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nrequires windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  this is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nbut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\njview is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in windows bmp format; but it can\\'t create new jpeg\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view gifs.  jview also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  the current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nwinjpeg (shareware, $20) displays jpeg,gif,targa,tiff, and bmp image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nit has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see note above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (this is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\ncolorview is another shareware entry ($30).  this was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over winjpeg.  if you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (i understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos.)\\n\\ndvpeg (see dos heading) also works under windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nos/2:\\n\\nthe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nnote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free ijg conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for os/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    image archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with pm graphical interface.\\n    strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    pmjpeg 1.1: os/2 2.x port of winjpeg, a popular viewer for windows\\n    (see description in windows section).  shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\\n    pmview 0.85: jpeg/gif/bmp viewer.  gif viewing very fast, jpeg viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of ram, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  strong 24-bit display support.  shareware, $20.\\n\\nmacintosh:\\n\\nmost mac jpeg programs rely on apple\\'s jpeg implementation, which is part of\\nthe quicktime system extension; so you need to have quicktime installed.\\nto use quicktime, you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running\\nsystem 6.0.7 or later.  (if you\\'re running system 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit quickdraw extension; this is built-in on system 7.)  you can get\\nquicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(as of 11/92, this file contains quicktime 1.5, which is better than qt 1.0\\nin several ways.  with respect to jpeg, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file.  however,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 1.5.)\\n\\nmac users should keep in mind that quicktime\\'s jpeg format, pict/jpeg, is\\nnot the same as the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format.  (see section 10 for\\ndetails.)  if you post images on usenet, make sure they are in jfif format.\\nmost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nthe first choice is probably jpegview, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in jfif format, pict/jpeg format, or gif format.  it also can\\nconvert between the two jpeg formats.  the current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  requires system 7 and\\nquicktime.  on 8-bit displays, jpegview usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers.  jpegview can\\nview large images in much less memory than other mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4mb mac.  given a large image, jpegview automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (you can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  overall, jpegview\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\ngifconverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports jfif and\\npict/jpeg, as well as gif and several other image formats.  the latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  requires system 6.0.5 or later.\\ngifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  also, the newest version of gifconverter can\\nload and save jfif images *without* quicktime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run quicktime.  (but it\\'s faster with quicktime.)\\nnote: if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg, try\\nconverting the file to gif with jpeg convert, then viewing the gif version.\\n\\njpeg convert, a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nthis will run on any mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nyou can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer.\\n\\nprevious versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6, a jpeg<=>gif\\nconverter based on an old version of the ijg code.  if you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert.\\n\\napple\\'s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif, quicktime jpeg, and\\ngif format, and can convert between these formats.  you can get pictpixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nrequires quicktime.  pictpixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime.\\nsome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  worse, pictpixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (there is an old version of pictpixie, called\\npictcompressor, floating around the net.  if you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  also, the quicktime starter kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor.  note that\\npicture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nstorm technology\\'s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer/converter.\\nthis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without system 7 or quicktime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (it does need 32-bit quickdraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  you must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'jpeg\\' to allow picture decompress to open it.\\n\\nif your machine is too old to run 32-bit quickdraw (a mac plus for instance),\\ngifconverter is your only choice for single-program jpeg viewing.  if you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for gifconverter, use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer.\\n\\nmore and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg, although not\\nall can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format.  adobe photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write jfif-format jpeg files (use the jpeg\\nplug-in from the acquire menu).  you must set the file type of a downloaded\\njpeg file to \\'jpeg\\' to allow photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\namiga:\\n\\n(most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  there are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  in the usa, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nhamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  it\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides jpeg.  the current version is 2.0.8.  a demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  the demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nrend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display jpeg, ilbm,\\nand gif images.  the program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like lightwave.  the\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for amigados 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\namigados 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nviewtek is a free jpeg/ilbm/gif/anim viewer.  the current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/viewtek104.lha.\\n\\nif you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support jpeg.  two are written by thomas krehbiel, the author of rend24\\nand viewtek.  these are cinemorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nimagefx, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph.  both are\\ndistributed by great valley products.  art department professional (adpro),\\nfrom asdg inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for amigas.  imagemaster, from black belt systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support.\\n\\nthe free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\namigajpegv4.lha.  these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm,gif,targa formats.\\n\\nthe amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty jpeg programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free ijg jpeg software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  among these are \"augjpeg\", \"newamyjpeg\",\\n\"vjpeg\", and probably others i have not even heard of.  in my opinion,\\nanything older than ijg version 3 (march 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\natari st:\\n\\nthe free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st, tt, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nthese programs convert jpeg to/from ppm, gif, targa formats.\\n\\nfor monochrome st monitors, try mgif, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  version 4.1 reads jpeg files.  available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\ni have not heard of any other free or shareware jpeg-capable viewers for\\nataris, but surely there must be some by now?  pointers appreciated.\\n\\nacorn archimedes:\\n\\n!changefsi, supplied with risc os 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\njpeg jfif format.  provision is also made to convert images to jpeg,\\nalthough this must be done from the cli rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nrecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program translator can handle\\njpeg, along with about 30 other image formats.  while older versions can be\\nfound on some archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, john kortink, nutterbrink 31, 7544 wj, enschede,\\nthe netherlands.  price 35 dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nthere\\'s also a commercial product called !jpeg which provides jpeg read/write\\nfunctionality and direct jpeg viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  this is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  contact: dt software, freepost,\\ncambridge, uk.  tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nportable software for almost any system:\\n\\nif none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\njpeg conversion software described in 6b.  you\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nif your display is 8 bits or less, any gif viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read targa\\nor ppm 24-bit image files.\\n\\nthere are numerous commercial jpeg offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  in that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the jfif file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6b]  if you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nfree, portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent\\njpeg group, which i lead.  a package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nthe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.z.

(this is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  we\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nclearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  it turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg (except at\\nthe very lowest jpeg quality settings).\\n\\nsince jpeg is a full-color format, converting a color jpeg image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  this is true for\\n*all* color jpegs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nthis happens because jpeg\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color jpeg on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a jpeg image.  even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different jpeg decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  i occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color jpeg\".  this tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this faq and (b) probably converted the jpeg from a gif.\\njpegs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for jpeg.)\\n\\non the other hand, a gif image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (a gif *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nfor purposes of usenet picture distribution, gif has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nthis is also the *disadvantage* of gif: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nfurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nfor this reason, jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\njpeg\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of jpeg\\nimages you already have.  with a gif, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nit\\'s also worth mentioning that many gif-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the gif, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  thus, jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average\\ngif program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nfinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" pc displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and macintoshes, etc.  for these people, gif is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nthus, jpeg is an all-around better choice than gif for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  how does jpeg work?\\n\\nthe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  this article\\'s long enough already, so i\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  for technical information, see the comp.compression faq.\\nthis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  if you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  what about lossless jpeg?\\n\\nthere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  the jpeg committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  however, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy jpeg\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  at present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless jpeg exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nsaying \"-q 100\" to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image.\\nwhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  there is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (with the v4 free jpeg code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  keep in mind that many commercial\\njpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\neven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular jpeg\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nat this minimum-loss setting, regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  true lossless jpeg\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nif you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\njbig bilevel image compression standard.  this performs better than jpeg\\nlossless on such images.  jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, jpeg is public domain (at least with a\\nhuffman back end), while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nstrictly speaking, jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  the jpeg committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nsince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  in the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nthe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at c-cube microsystems.  they have defined\\ntwo jpeg-based file formats:\\n  * jfif (jpeg file interchange format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * tiff/jpeg, aka tiff 6.0, an extension of the aldus tiff format.  tiff is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  tiff is\\n    a lot more complex than jfif, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of tiff.  it\\'s not likely that adding jpeg to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nboth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof jpeg-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\ni believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in\\npicture postings.  jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now; the\\ntiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  even when tiff/jpeg is well\\ndefined, the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; tiff/jpeg files may never be as transportable.\\n\\na particular case that people may be interested in is apple\\'s quicktime\\nsoftware for the macintosh.  quicktime uses a jfif-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the mac-specific pict structure.  conversion between jfif and\\nquicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward, and several mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see mac portion of section 6a).  if you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nanother particular case is handmade software\\'s programs (gif2jpg/jpg2gif and\\nimage alchemy).  these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif\\nformat.  by default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nhsi.  this format is not readable by any non-hsi programs and should not be\\nused for usenet postings.  use the -j switch to get jfif output.  (this\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit jfif\\nformat by default.  you still should be careful not to post hsi-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-pc platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  how do i recognize which file format i have, and what do i do about it?\\n\\nif you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format.  you can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  a jfif-standard file will start with the characters (hex) ff d8 ff e0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'jfif\\'.\\n\\n2.  if you see ff d8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw jpeg\" file.  this is probably decodable as-is by jfif software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  hsi files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  you\\'re out of luck unless you have hsi\\n    software.  portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-hsi programs.\\n\\n4.  a macintosh pict file, if jpeg-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a jfif header (scan for \\'jfif\\').  strip off\\n    everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not jpeg at all.  if you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream.\\n    if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream (look for ff d8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nin uuencoded usenet postings, the characteristic jfif pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tm_]c_x ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded hsi files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tm:\\'-i ...\\n\\nif you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-jfif files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  what about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nthe jpeg spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nthe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  on typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding.  (all the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding.)\\n\\nunfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\njpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm, at&t, and mitsubishi.\\nthus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (the \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nat least in the short run, i recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  in particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on usenet.\\n\\nthere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nit would be nice if, having compressed an image with jpeg, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nunfortunately this is not the case.  in general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nthe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical jpeg file.  even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree jpeg software.  it\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  if you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\none of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but i am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nin any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(if you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nif you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nthe bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  use a lossless format\\n(ppm, rle, tiff, etc) while working on the image, then jpeg it when you are\\nready to file it away.  aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg?\\n\\nas stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing gif image to jpeg.  if you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the gif was made from, it\\'s far better to make a jpeg from\\nthat.  but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nthe first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding gif;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  some gifs may be better left as gifs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the gif.  (so check the sizes too.)\\n\\nexperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality gifs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to jpeg.  they chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to jpeg with least degradation.\\ndon\\'t waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes.  also, don\\'t\\nexpect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  to maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\njpeg files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nmany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a gif image.  while useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in gif files.  it is not free in jpeg files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before jpeging.  (if you are on an x windows\\nsystem, xv\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor gif inputs, q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (if you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nq setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\ncolor gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store.\\nif you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  the\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to jpeg, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and jpeg can\\'t compress noise very well.  the resulting jpeg\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from jpeging the original full color image (if you had it).\\nto get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the gif image before compression.\\nsmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give jpeg trouble.  appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nwith the v4 free jpeg software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting gifs.\\nvalues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality gifs.  heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (if you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  if you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the pbmplus package.  however, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na lot faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nthe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting gifs.  but if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nfor more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in\\nparticular, contact the independent jpeg group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\ni opened the file with a text editor and it looks like:\\n\\n^vnetwork storyboardpictpict8bim^e^......\\n\\ni have already tried binhex which does not seem to work. \\nany other ideas?\\n\\n-- \\n', \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nliefting> the alt.* hierarchie is created for 2 purposes: 1. for\\nliefting> groups which do not fit under the comp.* or other 'official'\\nliefting> hierarchies 2. for the fast creation of hot new newsgroups\\nliefting> like alt.gulf.war\\n\\nliefting> because there is no voting process or any other control\\nliefting> facilities, sites are free to decide not to carry (some of)\\nliefting> the alt groups.\\n\\nliefting> therefore, it is (i think) desirable to try to create\\nliefting> comp.graphics.  {raytrace, rendering or whatever} and not an\\nliefting> alt-group\\n\\nplus, *many* sites, (especially many .com sites) do not carry any alt\\nnewsgroups.

the monitors usually used for viewing images). if you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. this is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nnow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a crt, you find that the crt _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. the amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nlight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nso if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt, the image\\nwill look much too dark. to fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. you need to do the opposite of what the crt\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. so you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nfor most crts, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nif that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nthe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nalso not all sources of images give you linear images (video cameras\\nor video signals in general). because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. if you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. if you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular crt.\\n\\nwhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nit is really three things. one is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nthe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nat least two file formats do the right thing.\\nthe utah graphics toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. the jfif file standard (that uses jpeg compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nsome image loaders (for instance xli - an x11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. other image viewers (eg. xv another x11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor.\\n\\n[ note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. you need to adjust the r, g and b curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the coledit controls. altering the intensity\\nin the hsv controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on h and s. this tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nhow can i figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nthe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a jfif jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. the ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  if your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (to find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nif your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nif your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. the value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the display_gamma\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nhow do i figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nthis is the most tricky bit. as a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. it seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nif your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nif your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nwhy linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\none of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nvideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. this is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. this means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. the implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nif some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(i am told that the kodak photocd format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).', \"hi!\\n\\nwe have an old montage fr-1 35mm film recorder. when connected to a pc with\\nits processor card it can directly take hpgl, targa and lasergraphics language\\nfiles. 24 bit targa is quite ok for raster images, but conversion from \\nwhatever one happens to have can be quite slow. this lasergraphics language\\nseems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector-based language\\nthat can handle one million colors. it does some polygons too, and perhaps\\nsomething else ?\\n\\nthe question is, where can i find some information about this language ?\\na ftp site, a book, a company address,.... ?\\n\\n(ok, it would be nice to have a windows driver for it, but i'm not that\\noptimistic...)\\n\\nthanks in advance for any help!\\n\\n\\tjussi\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\npeter> : > does anyone have any  other suggestions where the 42 came from?\\n\\npeter> yep, here's a theory that i once heard bandied around.  rather than thinking\\npeter> of the number think of the sound. for tea two. a sort of anagram on tea for two,\\npeter> two for tea, for tea two.\\n                    ~~~~~~~~~~~ \\nun other suggestion is there is no tea above! it just \\nand for two many things are possible; think binary, + -, y/n,\\nl/r, t/f  no wonder there was eve for adam! \\n\\npeter> :-)\\n \\nmalek :-) :-)\\n\\n--\\n malek.\", '\\n\\nwell 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel\\nseems like a bit excessive. i have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel\\nof 12 bits for computational precision. more than that would seem to be wasted.\\n\\nperhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to\\nrepresent the full range -

(american) i\\n  expect for idl and the other should be free.  those are the general\\n  purpose packages i\\'ve heard of, besides what terramar has.\\n  sips _was_ written for aviris imagery.  i\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask.  i\\n  have another piece of software (pcw) that does pc and walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  i\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte aviris images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external dsp card.  it will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  that\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"my  favorite is idl (interactive data language) from research systems,\\n  inc.  idl is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very pascal-like. it\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. personally, i like doing\\n  the number-crunching with idl on the vax (or mathematica, igor, or even\\n  excel on the mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to nih\\n  image for the imaging part. i have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to iraf) was incredible. by the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which i\\'ve been doing. this means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line i choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which i might do like in kaleidagraph.) \"\\n\\n[ for idl call research systems , for pv-wave call precision visuals and\\n for sips call university of colorado @ boulder . from what i can\\n understand, you

widgets are macro-widgets \\n  comprising lower level motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, \\n  menus, and drawing areas. it is designed to address the reusability \\n  of 2d visualization routines and each widget in the library is an \\n  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap \\n  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. it is targetted\\n  to run on unix workstations supporting osf/motif. currently, only \\n  color monitors are supported. since svlib is a collection of widgets \\n  developed in the same spirit as the osf/motif user interface widget \\n  set, it integrates seamlessly with the motif widgets. programmers \\n  using svlib widgets see the same interface and design as other \\n  motif widgets.\\n\\n  fvs is a

you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in vms anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  the standard pci environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to ibm-pc basic, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (in vms i can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure.)  there\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the pci\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  the pci software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  for instance, the tape i/o package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what adobe photoshop on the\\n  macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"ct2t\" format, would probably (i haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle targa, and so on. above all, however, you have to know what\\n  you\\'re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  it\\'s worth noting that the pci \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (i observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the pci \"database\").\\n\\n  i _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  on vax\\n  systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name gould/deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a pci \"database\" file to a peritek vct-q (q-bus\\n  24-bit directcolor) display subsystem.  pci software could be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a mac/pc largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  it\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada, a country which\\n  does a lot of its land/resource management via remote sensing; i believe\\n  the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nspam (spectral analysis manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  back in 1985 jpl developed something called spam (spectral analysis\\n  manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  that was designed\\n  for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for aviris (airborne visual and infrared imaging\\n  spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, pc and\\n  ihs transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  the original spam uses x or sunview to display.  the aviris version may\\n  require vicar, an executive based on tae, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  i can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  pcw requires x\\n  for display.\\n\\nmap ii\\n------\\n  among the mac gis systems, map ii is distributed by john wiley.\\n\\nclrview\\n-------\\n  clrview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of silicon graphics iris computers.\\n\\n  this program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from cad and gis sources.  it supports\\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as dxf,\\n  tin, dem, lattices, and arc/info coverages among others.\\n\\n  clrview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \\n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\\n\\n  contact:\\n

mapped\\nto this one palette colour. ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a\\n32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. \\nhaving done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?\\n\\napply the difference in rgb between the original and modified palette entry to\\neach colour in the group? this could generate colours with rgb outside the range\\n0...255. it would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth\\ncolour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.\\n\\nyou could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how\\nfar each colour was from the palette entry. however i suspect this would look\\nrather odd.\\n\\nso in summary, what i said in my previous posting still

p. 287-293.  note that\\nthe code from the \"graphics gems\" series is all available from an ftp site,\\nas described above.\\n\\ncheck out john bradley\\'s \"diversity algorithm\", which is incorporated into\\nthe xv package and described in the back of the manual.\\n\\nthe imagemagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another\\nquantizing algorithm which is presented as \"doing a better job than the\\nother algorithms, but slower\".\\n\\nthere\\'s also an implementation of:\\n\\nwan, wong, and prusinkiewicz, _an algorithm for multidimensional data\\nclustering_, transactions on mathematical software, vol. 14 #2 (june, 1988),\\npp. 153-162.\\n\\navialable as princeton.edu:pub/graphics/colorquant.shar.  this code,\\nin modified form, appears in the utah raster toolkit as well.\\n\\n\\n4) converting color into grayscale.\\n\\nthe ntsc formula is:\\n\\n    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue\\n\\n\\n5) quantizing grayscale to black&white.\\n\\nthe only reference you need for this stuff is:\\n\\n    digital halftoning, robert ulichney, mit press 1987, isbn 0-262-21009-6\\n\\nbut before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation\\nsoftware mentioned in item 7 below.  all of the packages mentioned can do\\nsome form of gray to b&w conversion.\\n\\n\\n6) rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.\\n\\nthe obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source\\nimage, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.\\nthis is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  instead,\\nloop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*\\ntransformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.\\nthis method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one\\n2-d mapping, not just rotation.  you can add anti-aliasing by doing\\nsub-pixel sampling.\\n\\nhowever, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,\\nwhich involves doing three shear operations.  the method was originally\\ncreated for the im raster toolkit (see below); an implementation is\\nalso present in pbmplus.  reference: \"a fast algorithm for raster\\nrotation\", by alan paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) graphics\\ninterface \\'86 (vancouver).  an article on the im toolkit appears in\\nthe same journal.  an updated version of the rotation paper appears\\nin \"graphics gems\" (see section [1]) under the original title.\\n\\n\\n7) free image manipulation software.\\n\\nthere are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to\\nanother, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus\\nthe above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.\\nhere are pointers to some of them:\\n\\n    xv

number of automated mail servers that will\\nsend you things like this in response to a message.  see item 13 below for\\ndetails on some.\\n\\nalso, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion\\nof software like this.  you may find useful information there.\\n\\n\\n8) format documents for tiff, iff, biff, nff, off, fits, etc.\\n\\nyou almost certainly don\\'t need these.  read the above item 7 on free\\nimage manipulation software.  get one or more of these packages and\\nlook through them.  chances are excellent that the image converter you\\nwere going to write is already there.  but if you still want one of the\\nformat documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from\\nzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.\\n\\nthese files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.\\nthis archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object\\nformats.  the future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as mark\\nhall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.\\n\\na second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained\\nby quincey koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  the latest version exists at\\nftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  apparently,\\nneither of these is complete, you might want to check

a regular monthly fits basics and\\ninformation posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.\\n\\n\\n\\n9) converting between vector formats.\\n\\na lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript, or macdraw\\nto cgm, or whatever.  it is important to understand that this is a very\\ndifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  converting\\none image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you\\nget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects\\nare the same for all image formats.  this is not so for vector formats.\\nthe basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled\\nround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.\\nexcept in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do\\na one-to-one conversion between vector formats.\\n\\nthere is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp.psc.edu.  the\\ncontributor states that it runs on unix, ms-windows, and possibly the mac.\\na better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.\\n\\non the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,\\nrendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.\\nas far as i know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such\\nconverters, but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been\\nposted to comp.sources.misc.  check the index on your nearest archive\\nsite.\\n\\na related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format\\nto a bitmapped image - from postscript to sun raster format, or hpgl to\\nx11 bitmap.  for example, some of the commercial postscript clones for\\npc\\'s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  also,\\nthe postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun\\'s x11/news can\\nbe used to render to a file if you\\'re clever.  but in general, the\\nanswer is no.  however, if someone were to put together a vector to\\nvector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be\\ntrivial.\\n\\ngnu ghostscript (from the fsf - current version 2.5.2) includes\\ndrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as\\na postscript to ppm  or a postscript to gif filter.  (it implements\\nessentially all of postscript level 1 and alot of display postscript\\nand level 2).\\n\\n\\n10) how to get pixar films.\\n\\nthe various john lasseter / pixar computer animated shorts are available\\non video tape.  you can order them from direct cinema limited:\\n\\n    film                           individual price      institutional price\\n    luxo, jr.\\t\\t\\t\\t$14.95\\t\\t\\t$50.00\\n    red\\'s dream\\t\\t\\t\\t$19.95\\t\\t\\t$75.00\\n    tin toy\\t\\t\\t\\t$24.95\\t\\t\\t$75.00\\n    knickknack\\t\\t\\t\\t$24.95\\t\\t\\t$75.00\\n    luxo, jr./red\\'s dream/tin toy\\t$39.95\\t\\t\\t$100.00\\n\\nall tapes are on 1/2\" vhs ntsc.  add $10/tape for pal format.  also\\navailable:\\n\\n    tin toy t-shirt\\t\\t\\t$15.00\\n    knickknack 3d t-shirt\\t\\t$15.00 (includes glasses)\\n\\nfor individual orders, add $5 s&h for the first tape or shirt, $2 for\\neach additional tape or shirt.  for institutional orders, add $5 s&h\\nfor the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  foreign shipping, add\\n$3/tape or shirt.  call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,\\n213-396-3233 fax) to charge to your credit card.  call first to verify\\nprices and availability.  or, just write to:\\n\\n    direct cinema limited\\n    1749 14th street\\n    santa monica, ca 90404-4342\\n\\nallan braunsdorf has this to say:\\n\\nat siggraph they were selling a tape with all four shorts\\nfor $25.  that was a sale price.  you can get it for slightly\\nmore than that normally.

\"you can\\'t.\"  unless you use a rational spline you\\ncan only approximate a circle.  the approximation may look acceptable,\\nbut it is sensitive to scale.  magnify the scale and the error of\\napproximation magnifies.  deviations from circularity that were not\\nvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  if you want to\\ndo the job right, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"a

usenet sources newsgroups\\nand make them available via an email query system.  you send a message\\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\\n\\nin addition, there is at least one ftp-by-mail server.  send mail to\\nftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying \"help\" and it will tell you how to use\\nit.  note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.\\n\\n\\n14) how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.\\n\\nconsider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to\\ninfinity.  if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,\\nthe point is within the polygon.  if the ray crosses an even number of\\nedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior\\nhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  this idea is known in\\nthe trade as the jordan curve theorem; see eric haines\\' article in\\nglassner\\'s ray tracing book (above) for more information, including\\ntreatment of special cases.\\n\\nanother method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all\\nthe vertices on the polygon.  if the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,\\nif the sum is 0 the point is outside.  however, this method is about an\\norder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the\\ntrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.\\n\\ncode for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in\\nthe ray tracing news, vol. 5, no. 3, available from

no software\\n      (this is good, imho - i prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).\\n      questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.\\n\\n\\n21) what about gif?\\n\\ngif stands for graphics interchange format.  it is portable and usable upon\\na wide variety of platforms.  it is quite limited in some ways (yes, the\\nkeeper of the faq has some opinions after all), and in fact, i don\\'t like\\nit much.  however, it looks to me like the most-frequently asked question\\nwhich was not previously covered in this list.  the following is a list\\nof newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about gif.\\n\\nsubject: alt.binaries.pictures faq - general info\\nsubject: alt.binaries.pictures faq - os specific info\\nnewsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers\\n\\navailable in the indicated usenet newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from\\npit-manager.mit.edu in the files:\\n\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\\n\\nalso available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail\\nmessage containing any or all of:\\n\\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\nsend

8, and\\n20 above for more information.\\n\\n\\n22) what is morphing?\\n\\nwarping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new\\nlocation. morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.\\nvalerie hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and\\nmorphing. this is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au\\nin the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/morph. there are three files:\\n\\n        morph_intro.ps.z     (postscript version, many pictures - 1.5m)\\n        morph_intro.txt.z    (text version)\\n        m_responses.z        (responses to morphing questions)\\n\\nthe files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and\\nuncompress them afterwards.\\n\\n\\n23) how to ray-trace height fields\\n\\nheight fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  they have a number of uses,\\nsuch as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  thus, they\\nget their own faq section.  note that further references can no doubt be\\nlocated via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.\\n\\nthe following paper seems to be the definitive reference:\\n\\nf. kenton musgrave\\ngrid tracing: fast ray tracing for height fields\\njuly, 1988\\n<musg88.ps.z>\\n\\nthis is available as \"research report yaleu/dcs/rr-639\" from yale university,\\nit\\'s also in the siggraph \\'91 fractal modeling in 3d computer graphics and\\nimaging course notes, and (best of all) it\\'s available on the net:\\n\\n    nic.funet.fi\\t\\tpub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.z\\n

find the area of a 3d polygon\\n\\n\\tthe area of a triangle is given by (in c notation),\\n\\n     area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -\\n\\t            ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );\\n\\nand the area of a planar polygon is given by\\n\\n     area = 0.0;\\n\\n     for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ )\\n         area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );\\n     area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );\\n     area /= 2.0;\\n\\nif the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is\\nclockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise.\\n\\n of planar polygons and volume of polyhedra:\"\\n\\nthe area of a polygon p0, p1, p2, ... pn, not in the x-y plane, is\\ngiven by\\n\\n     area(polygon) = 1/2 * | n . sigma { pk x pk+1 } |\\n\\nwhere n is the unit vector normal to the plane and p is a polygonal\\nvertex.  the . represents the dot product operator and the x\\nrepresents the cross product operator.  sigma represents the summation\\noperator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  pn+1 is equal\\nto p0.\\n\\n\\n25) how to join acm/siggraph\\n\\nprobably the easiest way to join acm/siggraph is to trot over to your\\nlocal technical library and find a copy of communications of the acm.\\nsomewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.\\nfill it out and mail it in.  acm

listing', \"\\n\\nyes.  here's what you should do.\\n\\nkeep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay,\\nbut n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into\\nthe array of the vertices that comprise them.  you set a flag for each\\nvertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertex\\nmore than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the\\npolygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have\\nto be transformed at all.\\n\\nwhenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hither\\nplane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.\\n\\nthen do your z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their\\nprojection done at that stage.\\n\", 'i believe many people will be happy to have this information.   so, \\nplease post it to the comp.graphics.', 'if anyone has a list of companies doing data visualization (software\\nor hardware) i would like to hear from them.  thanks.\\n\\n\\t-- krs\\n-- ', '\\n    first of all (this is not a snide response), if you\\'re confused about\\nthis issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  i suggest\\nthat the weakness is your reference material.  get \"an introduction to ray\\ntracing\" by andrew glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing\\nalgorithm.  you could also refer to the 2nd edition of foley & van dam.\\n\\n    on to the question.  the simple answer is that you just keep adding up\\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  for\\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that\\'s another issue =^).  so, you\\nget some illumination equation like this:\\n\\n        i = lambient + ldiffuse(light[n]) + lreflected + ltransparent\\n\\n    the contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  now, a slightly less\\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\\n\\n        i = kala + kdld(light[n]) + krlr + ktlt\\n\\n    that is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\\nmaterial constants ka, kd, kr and kt.  so the maximum you can get from\\ntransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a\\npurple-colored glass object.\\n\\n    hopefully this answers your question.  i\\'ll forward my \"illumination\\nequation sermon\" to

maybe someone can donate a large scsi\\nhard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>\\n\\ni have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the\\nlist can obtain information as well

to:\\n\\n        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nthe first command to the server must be \"help\" or \"user name <passwd>\".\\n\\nuse help to request a current copy of the helpfile.\\nuse user name [passwd] to connect to the service.\\nuse ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.\\n\\n\\n\\n-- now what do i do? --\\n\\nwell, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  if you have\\nsomething to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to\\nthe list.  every little bit helps.  questions are welcomed!  it makes\\nsome of us feel important when we can answer

maps--many of which played a key role in\\nthe humanist recovery of the classical heritage of greece and\\nrome.  the exhibition presents the untold story of the vatican\\nlibrary as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of\\nrome as a political and scholarly superpower during the\\nrenaissance.  the exhibit will be on display in the jefferson\\nbuilding of the library of congress from january 8, 1993 through\\napril 30, 1993.  the online exhibit will be available by\\nanonymous ftp indefinitely.\\n\\n     the exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  the vatican\\nlibrary, archaeology, humanism, mathematics, music, medicine &\\nbiology, nature described, a wider world i: how the orient came\\nto rome, and a wider world ii: how rome went to china.  each\\nsection consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit\\ndirectory and contains the exhibit text for that section and\\nseparate jpeg image files for each object.  this online exhibit\\nincludes not only objects from the library of congress exhibit,\\nbut also the alternate objects (brought from rome to be used if\\nthere were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items\\nomitted later in the planning process.\\n\\n     this exhibit will be of interest to medieval and renaissance\\nscholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of\\nscience or medicine, early music scholars, students of the\\nhumanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,\\ntheologians, scholars of both far and near eastern studies, and\\nto librarians and information professionals.  please get the\\nreadme file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  if\\nyou have questions about how to use ftp, speak to your local\\ncomputer support person.  if you have
